## Context

Whilst choosing to develop a custom UI for allowing a date value to be selected within a web page can guarantee cross-browser support and consistent behaviour, it can also result in poor accessibility. A screen reader user may find it difficult, or in some cases impossible to select and set a date value using a custom developped date picker UI. This design pattern presents a solution for developing a custom date picker UI, that when implemented optimizes accessibility for screen reader users.git
